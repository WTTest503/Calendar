                    strive to keep it friendly and respectful. Provide other players

                        Our community includes a range of diverse people and we are
                        dedicated to bringing people together through their shared love
                        of games. No matter who sits down at the table with us, we
                        make them feel safe and welcome.

                        Each of us needs to help maintain a neat and clean community
                        area. Please use the provided trash cans.

                        Helping a new player to learn the rules is the most valuable
                        thing any person can provide to our community. Discussing
                        strategies, offering tips, or constructively critiquing game play
                        decisions after games are concluded helps both participants to
                        become better players.

                        fair and honest. Foul or abusive language will not be tolerated.

                        Trades are allowed but solicitation and/or purchasing is not
